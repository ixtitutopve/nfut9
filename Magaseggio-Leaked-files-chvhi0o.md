Magaseggio's journey into the world of social media began with her love for gaming. She started streaming on Twitch under the username "GingerBreaker" in 2013, where she gained a small but dedicated following. Magaseggio's charisma and infectious energy shone through her streams, making her a popular figure in the gaming community. Magaseggio has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
